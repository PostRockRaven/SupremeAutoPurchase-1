# SupremeAutoPurchase v1.0
## This project is still in development. It is designed to run with PhantomJS
### There is another branch that runs with firefox, it is slightly slower.
#### SupremeAutoPurchase is a bot that will purchase new clothing drops on supremenewyork.com


###Requirements
- python 2.7
- PhantomJS driver

####Installation
```sh install.sh```

####Usage
Modify config.ini with the product you wish to purchase, shipping information and payment info.
<br>
```Python buy.py```

Be specific about what product you wish to purchase.
The 'SelectOption' refers to the extra option for some products, in most cases it is a size parameter, occasionally it's a quantity field.
I will improve on this soon.


Thanks to @Hezion and @kaaetech for their help. They both have good forks of this project.


####11/15/16 Update

<b>TODO</b>: Improve on product finding features, primarly the color and selectOption features
